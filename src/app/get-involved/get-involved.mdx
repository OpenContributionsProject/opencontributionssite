# Get Involved

We'd love to have you help out with the project! ‚ô•Ô∏è

## Content Writing

Much of this project involves writing explainers and guides for various audiences and goals.
See our [_area: documentation_ issues](https://github.com/OpenContributionsProject/opencontributionssite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22area%3A+documentation%22) for ones you can get started on.

## Data

If you're someone involved in data analytics, data science, or any other kind of related area, it'd be lovely to have you help us quantify the benefits of contributing to open source.
See our [_area: data gathering_ issues](https://github.com/OpenContributionsProject/opencontributionssite/labels/area%3A%20data%20gathering) for ones you can get started on.

## Design

The site is a little visually bland right now.
We're going to need to make it presentable, with a full site theme and backing design system.
See our [_area: design_ issues](https://github.com/OpenContributionsProject/opencontributionssite/labels/area%3A%20data%20gathering) for ones you can get started on.

## Development

Once the site has a theme and design system designed, we'll want to implement it.
We don't particularly need development resources just yet, but if you're particularly excited then let us know!
We can find something for you to work on.
