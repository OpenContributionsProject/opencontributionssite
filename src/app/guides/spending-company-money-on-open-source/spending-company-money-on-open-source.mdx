# Guide: Spending Company Money on Open Source

So you work at a company and you'd like to direct a budget towards sponsoring open source software.
That's great!
This guide will walk you through common steps in:

1. **[Getting a Budget](#getting-a-budget)**: Tapping into existing company motivations to get money to spend
1. **[Picking Projects](#getting-a-budget)**: Finding projects that fit best into those motivations
1. **[Quantifying Benefits](#quantifying-benefits)**: Proving that the sponsorships are doing what they're meant to

## Getting a Budget

Before you can spend corporate money, you'll typically have to identify where in the budget it comes from, and justify it to financial decision-makers.
You'll likely need to tap into existing goals the company would be willing to spend money on.
Companies often want to be able to quantifiably link money spent to existing initiatives.

Commonly fundable initiatives in many companies are:

- **Hiring**: Attracting more talent for recruiting, especially developers
- **Marketing**: Getting the company name seen online, especially by developers
- **Morale**: Appeasing opinionated developers who already work at the company
- **Stability**: Helping long-term maintenance of projects the company depends on

Start by talking to your manager to identify who you'll have to convince, and what motivations are most convincing to them.

## Picking Projects

Depending on what motivations you used to get a budget, you're likely looking to invest in one or both of the following strategies:

- **[Flagship Projects](#flagship-projects)**: Getting as much "bang per buck" as possible, if your goals are around developer branding & hiring
- **[Shared Funding](#shared-funding)**: Minimizing hassle, and/or fairly compensating projects based on how much they're used

Most companies generally start with _flagship projects_, as they're easier to demonstrate benefits around.

### Flagship Projects

The ideal flagship projects are those whose improvements benefit you directly, are seen by many developers, and will post your company logo in a visible location.
Companies often choose flagship projects based on two criteria:

- **Relevancy**: How relevant the project is to the company's tech stack (especially if the company directly uses the project)
- **Visibility**: How much publicity is gained per dollar spent of sponsorship (especially in development areas you want to hire for)

To find projects that match those criteria, consider:

1. Making a list of all open source projects you consume
2. Filtering the list to projects that:
   - Have some threshold of visibility (e.g. >1k GitHub Stars)
   - Place sponsor links & logos somewhereÂ visible in their documentation
3. Identifying remaining projects that are relevant to the developers you'd want to hire

For an example of flagship projects chosen by a company, see this [Codecademy 2022 Open Source Sponsorships](https://medium.com/codecademy-engineering/codecademy-2022-open-source-sponsorships-df8609558319) article.

### Shared Funding

If you don't need to demonstrate immediate impact from funding, you can always donate to shared funding services.
These services will take a flexible amount of sponsorship funds each month and distribute it automatically to your dependencies.

Popular shared funding services include:

- [StackAid](https://stackaid.us): Distributes your funds for you amongst dependencies and their dependencies
- [Tidelift](https://tidelift.com): Requires open source projects meet maintenance standards such as documentation and security updates
- [Thanks.dev](https://thanks.dev): Trickles donations through your dependency tree, with weighting customization options

## Quantifying Benefits

Being able to demonstrate real benefits of open source sponsorships will help make sure the expenditures are approved year-to-year.
See how you can show how the funding directly ties to the motivation(s) used to justify it.

For example:

- **Hiring**: Poll candidates on whether the open source sponsorships make them more likely to want to work at your company
- **Marketing**: Add something like [UTM parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters) to links advertised by projects
- **Morale**: Run developer satisfaction surveys internally, and include questions around commitment to open source
- **Stability**: See if the projects include release notes crediting anything to sponsorships - or ask the maintainers yourself if not

Tip: when asked, many maintainers are happy to advocate for their projects being funded.

### Marketing Sponsorships

Spreading the word about your project sponsorships will help gain social capital for justifying their continued existence.
At the very least, try to:

- Write a blog post on your company's blog describing your open source sponsorships program and funded projects
- Share that post out on social media
- Solicit other employees to get involved with the sponsorships, such as in deciding projects to fund

The more people who know about your company's open source sponsorships, the more likely that recognition is to help justify more sponsorships.
