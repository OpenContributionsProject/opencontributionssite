## How To Get Funding For Your Open Source Projects

# Overview

As wonderful as open source is, one of the biggest challenges maintained projects can face is finding sustainable funding.
Now, don’t fret! Here are some suggestions on how to get funding for your open source projects as well as some legalities to consider in determining how to get these resources.

## Direct Sponsorships

Direct sponsorship is the most straightforward way to get funding for your project.
When a user or a different company wants to sponsor your project, they send the funds right to your project’s financial account.
Here is a list of resources that provide direct sponsorships:

- **GitHub Sponsors**: This is a popular option that creators use to fund their projects.
  It allows you to choose the number of tiers you charge and rewards that you can offer to potential sponsors.
  It also provides you with the opportunity to support other developers and organizations, which can be a good way to network with others and gain more support.
  If you’re interested in using this resource, check out the official website for more information: [https://github.com/sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors)
- **Open Collective**: This is a company that is devoted to supporting and promoting open source projects.
  Like GitHub sponsors, they allow you to choose the number of tiers you charge and reward you with potential sponsors.
  In contrast, Open Collective lets you see [your project's transactions and granular expenses](https://medium.com/open-collective/on-github-sponsors-5450b63caf7d).

## Aggregated sponsorships

In contrast to direct sponsorships, aggregated sponsorships are usually provided by a company or organization that can pool funds together.
The benefits of this option are that you can get financial support from a larger pool of donors.
Here is a list of resources that offer aggregated sponsorships:

- **Tidelift**: In addition to providing tools to help you maintain your project, Tidelift offers maintainers various ways to receive financial support.
  For example, you can connect your [GitHub Sponsors](https://tidelift.com/subscription/how-to-connect-tidelift-with-github) account to Tidelift and get paid based on the number of sponsors you have.
