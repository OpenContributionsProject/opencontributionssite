## How To Get Funding For Your Open Source Projects


# Overview:

As wonderful as open source is, one of the biggest challenges maintained projects face is finding funding, especially ones that are sustainable. Now, don’t fret! Here are some suggestions on how to get funding for your open source projects as well as some legalities to consider in determining how to get these resources.


## Direct Sponsorships:

Direct sponsorship is the most straightforward way to get funding for your project. When a user or a different company wants to sponsor your project, they send the funds right to your project’s financial account. Here is a list of resources that provide direct sponsorships: 




* **GitHub Sponsors**: This is a popular option that creators use to fund their projects. It allows you to choose the number of tiers you charge and rewards that you can offer to potential sponsors. It also provides you with the opportunity to support other developers and organizations, which can be a good way to network with others and gain more support. If you’re interested in using this resource, check out the official website for more information: [https://github.com/sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors)
* **Open Collective**: This is a company that is devoted to supporting and promoting open source projects. Like GitHub sponsors, they allow you to choose the number of tiers you charge and reward you with potential sponsors. In contrast, Open Source Collective provides information on how the money is being used.

## Aggregated sponsorships


In contrast to direct sponsorships, aggregated sponsorships are usually provided by a company or organization that can pool funds together. The benefits of this option are that you can get financial support from a larger pool of people on a regular basis, which can be a good way to keep your project funded. Here is a list of resources that offer aggregated sponsorships: 




* **Tidelift**: In addition to providing tools to help you maintain your project, Tidelift offers maintainers various ways to receive financial support. For example, you can connect your [GitHub Sponsors](https://tidelift.com/subscription/how-to-connect-tidelift-with-github) account to Tidelift and get paid based on the number of sponsors you have.

## Legal paperwork needed for employees contributing to open source projects:

Since various people are going to contribute to your project, it is important to ensure that you have the right contracts in place to ensure your project is legally protected. Here are some examples of legal paperwork that you can distribute to your employees:

* **Apache License 2.0**: If you want to make sure that your open source project is not modified and distributed too freely, consider using this license.

## Common legal work/paperwork needed to publish projects as open source: 

In addition to the above, you need to make sure that you have the following documents and paperwork ready to ensure that your projects are legally published as open source:



* **Developer Certificate of Origin(DCO)**: This is a declaration that states that each commit that a developer makes to your project is authorized by you. If you want to learn more about this document, check out this link: [https://developercertificate.org/](https://developercertificate.org/)

* **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)**: This document defines the terms under which a license is granted by a contributor to an open source project.
