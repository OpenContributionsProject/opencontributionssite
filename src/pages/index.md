# Open Contributions Project

An effort to describe and quantify corporate contributions to open source.
Our goal is to empower employees advocating for open source contributions to their employers. üíô

## Project Goals

We plan on tackling two project focuses, in order of complexity:

- [**Explaining**](#explaining-open-source-contributions): writing convincing, data-backed resources for why open source contributions are in company‚Äôs best interests.
- [**Quantifying**](#quantifying-corporate-open-source-contributions): creating a tracking service that spotlights open source contributions already being done by companies.

## Explaining Open Source Contributions

_We_ know that donating money and time to open source is the correct and right thing for companies to do.
But financial decision-makers act only when motivated to.
They need real reasons -ideally metrics- and/or research-based- that demonstrate why potential investments will be net positive for the company.

### Documentation

Our project will start by creating a documentation website explaining:

- **What** open source is, for both non-technical and technical individuals
- **Why** contributing is beneficial to both the company and their industry
- **How** can companies contribute: employee time, free services, and/or monetary

We will also create ‚Äúexplainer‚Äù documents tailored to:

- Financial leaders (e.g. CFOs)
- Operations leaders (e.g. COOs)
- Technical leaders (e.g. CTOs)

### Research

Advocating for a cause to an organization necessitates being able to prove why the cause is worthwhile.
This often comes via a combination of two forms:

- **Anecdotal**: Real-world stories of how taking on the cause has benefitted organizations
- **Data**: Showing quantifiable results that seem to reinforce the cause being beneficial

Anecdotally, we have found data-informed approaches to be much more effective in convincing financial decision-makers.

## Quantifying Corporate Open Source Contributions

Once our documentation and explainer pages are filled out on the site, we will expand our scope to becoming a public record of positive open source contributions by companies.

We intend to track two kinds of contributions:

- **Employee time**: During work hours, spending employee time on open source projects
- **Financial**: Monetary donations, including sponsorship donations and product discounts

Contributions will also be tracked in the context of what kind of recipient open source project:

- **Community**: Projects whose maintainers operate independently of a sole backing company
- **Maintenance**: Projects whose maintainers answer to and work for a company

We plan on creating open source data initially tracking the larger open source contributions of companies such as Facebook, Github, and Sentry.
It is will be positioned as a crowdsourced repository similar to DefinitelyTyped or Wikipedia.

We will also investigate augmenting site data automatically when possible, such as with public financial records and APIs for services such as Tidelift.
